## Juggad â€“ Wordpress Theme for Team Collaboration 

## What is Jugaad

Jugad is a wordpress theme which turns your wordpress blog in an awesome collabration platform. This is well suited for internal teams, specially when emails are not a good option. We at [aahho](http://aahho.com/) have stopped relying on the email completely for quite sometime now do most of our communications via Jugaad.
